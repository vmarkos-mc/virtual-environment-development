# Virtual Environment Design & Development (Unreal Engine 5)

This repository contains the course material for **Virtual Environment Design & Development**. This course focuses on the principles, tools, and workflows used to create immersive digital worlds for games, simulations, VR (Virtual Reality), and AR (Augmented Reality) applications, with a dedicated focus on the **Unreal Engine 5.x** pipeline.

We will cover essential topics such as spatial design, asset integration, lighting and atmosphere, performance optimization, and the use of UE5's visual scripting system (Blueprints) and C++ framework.

## Repository Structure

The course is organized into weekly modules. Each module contains conceptual explanations, practical tutorials, project files, and sample assets (or links to external asset stores) that are compatible with Unreal Engine 5.

| Folder | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `Week 01 - Introduction` | Covers the definition of virtual environments, design principles (immersion, fidelity), and the setup process for **Unreal Engine 5.x**. |
| `LICENSE` | The MIT License for this project. |
| ... | *More weekly modules will cover topics like 3D Asset Integration, Lighting and Post-Processing, Terrain Generation, **Blueprint Scripting** for Interactivity, and Performance Optimization for VR/AR in UE5.* |

## Getting Started

To follow the course and work with the practical examples, you will need access to the Unreal Engine.

### Prerequisites

* **Unreal Engine 5.x:** Installed via the Epic Games Launcher.
* **3D Modeling Software (Optional):** Basic familiarity with tools like Blender or Maya for external asset creation.
* **Basic Scripting:** Knowledge of C++ or **Blueprints** is helpful for interactive labs.

### Running the Examples

All examples are provided as Unreal Engine project files.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/vmarkos-mc/virtual-environment-development.git](https://github.com/vmarkos-mc/virtual-environment-development.git)
    cd virtual-environment-development
    ```

2.  **Open the Unreal Project:**
    Navigate to the specific week's folder, locate the main project file (e.g., `MyProject.uproject`), and open it directly. The Unreal Engine Launcher or the engine itself should handle the rest.
    
    *(Tip: Ensure Unreal Engine 5.x is associated with the `.uproject` file extension on your system.)*

3.  **Check Documentation:**
    Always refer to the accompanying `README.md` or dedicated documentation file within each weekly module for specific instructions on required assets, scene setup, and how to run the example levels.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions! Whether it's an optimized scene, an improved Blueprint script, or suggestions for better performance settings within UE5, please submit a pull request.

1.  **Fork** the repository.
2.  **Create** your feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/improved-blueprint-interactivity`).
3.  **Commit** your changes (`git commit -m 'Refactored Blueprint for clearer player interaction'`).
4.  **Push** to the branch (`git push origin feature/improved-blueprint-interactivity`).
5.  **Open a Pull Request**.
